I usually get around 5000 to 7000 soft clay per hour wich translates to 250k to 350k gp/h approximately with a 50gp price difference for Soft/Hard clay.
It performs about half the speed a human would achieve. Its mostly hindered by the amount of miss clicking when banking. This is an issue with RuneMate, not this bot in particular.
